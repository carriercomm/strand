This is intended to be an open-source CMS, used for simple and elegant projects. It is built in Ruby on Sinatra, and features basic blog and content management functionality. Iâ€™ve started putting together the basic proof-of-concept CRUD here.

<pre><%= @dpm %></pre>
<%	@nodes.each do |node| %>
		<a href="/node/<%= node.blobref %>"><%= node.title || node.blobref %></a><br />
<% end %>
